## Overview

- Track live Solana transactions
- Send notification to several destination (Slack, Telegram, Discord)

## How It Works

Jito Bell monitors Solana transactions in real-time, focusing on SPL Stake Pool and Jito Vault activities, and sends notifications when significant events occur.

### Transaction Monitoring Flow

1. Transaction Subscription
  - Jito Bell connects to a Solana RPC endpoint and subscribes to transaction stream
  - The system filters for transactions involving the SPL Stake Pool program (SPoo1Ku8WFXoNDMHPsrGSTSG1Y47rzgn41SLUNakuHy) and Jito Vault program (Vau1t6sLNxnzB7ZDsef8TLbPLfyZMYXH8WTNqUdm9g8)
  - Each transaction is captured as it occurs on the blockchain

2. Transaction Processing
  - Raw transaction information is received from the RPC
  - The parser analyzes each transaction to identify specific types:
    - For SPL Stake Pool: IncreaseValidatorStake, DepositStake, WithdrawStake, DepositSol, WithdrawSol, DecreaseValidatorStakeWithReserve
    - For Jito Vault: MintTo, EnqueueWithdrawal
  - Transaction data is decoded to extract relevant information like amount, accounts involved

3. Event Filtering
  - Configurable thresholds determine which transactions trigger notifications
  - Examples of noteworthy events:
      - Large deposits (e.g., over 1000 SOL)
      - Significant withdrawals

4. Notification Dispatch
  - When a transaction meets notification criteria, alerts are sent to configured destinations
  - Support notification channels:
    - Slack
    - Discord
    - Telegram

### Configuration
The system is highly configurable through the `jito_bell_config.yaml` file:

Set different notification thresholds for various transaction types
Configure multiple notification destinations with different filtering rules
Customize notification formats and information included
Define which program instructions to monitor

## Getting Started

### Create Webhook URL

If you don't know how to create it, you can follow [Webhook Integration Guide](https://github.com/jito-foundation/jito-bell/wiki/Webhook-Integration-Guide).

### Create `.env` file

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### Create ` jito_bell_config.yaml`

```bash
cp jito_bell_config_example.yaml jito_bell_config.yaml
```

### Build

```bash
docker build -t jito-bell .
```

### Run

```bash
docker run jito-bell \
  -e "https://your-endpoint.com" \
  -x-token "your-token-here" \
  -account-include SPoo1Ku8WFXoNDMHPsrGSTSG1Y47rzgn41SLUNakuHy \
